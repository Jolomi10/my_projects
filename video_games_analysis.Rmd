This Project is going to be such an interesting one! Video games were such a big part of my childhood as it was something my brothers and I bonded over.Before our very eyes, the video game industry has grown so much the evolution is nothing short of mind-blowing. For this analysis, I'll be considering sales data of PS4 and  Xbox one video games.I'll like to discover which video games, genre and publishers have the highest ratings at a global level. It'll also be nice to know which year between 2014 - 2018 produced the highest rated video games for both PS4 and Xbox One.

## Installing Packages
```{r , error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/PACKAGES")
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
install.packages("janitor", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/PACKAGES")
library(janitor)

```



## Loading Datasets

```{r , results='hide'}
ps4_game_sales <- read.csv("video_games/PS4_GamesSales.csv")
View(ps4_game_sales)
```

```{r , results='hide'}
xboxone_game_sales <- read.csv("video_games/XboxOne_GameSales.csv")
View(xboxone_game_sales)
```

## Cleaning the Data

I'll go on to clean the two data sets to ensure that I get accurate results from this analysis.

```{r}
# I'll view the structure of the data sets to understand to familiarize myself with it.
str(ps4_game_sales)
```
```{r}
str(xboxone_game_sales)
```
From what I can observe, the data types are appropriate. Awesome! But I always prefer to have the column names in lowercase and seprated with underscores. I'll fix that real quick.

```{r , results='hide'}
ps4_game_sales <- clean_names(ps4_game_sales)
xboxone_game_sales <- clean_names(xboxone_game_sales)
```

```{r}
str(ps4_game_sales)

```
```{r}
str(xboxone_game_sales)

```

Much better!

Next, I'll check for blanks in both datasets (N/A)
```{r}
 ps4_game_sales%>% 
  is.na() %>% 
  colSums() %>% 
  sort(decreasing=TRUE)
```
```{r}
xboxone_game_sales %>% 
  is.na() %>%
  colSums() %>% 
  sort(decreasing=TRUE)
```
Perfect! Our data is squeeky clean! 

## Video Game Analysis

### Video games with the Highest Global Rating
#### PS4
```{r}
top_ps4_games <- ps4_game_sales %>%
  select(game,genre,global) %>%
  group_by(game,global) %>%
  filter(global>=10) %>%
  arrange(desc(global))

ggplot(data = top_ps4_games) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = game, y = global, color = game))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+
  labs(title = "Highest rated PS4 video game", subtitle = "2014-2019")

```

As we can clearly see, Grand Theft Auto V had the highest global rating among all PS4 games put out between 2014-2019.

#### Xbox One
```{r}
top_xboxone_games <- xboxone_game_sales %>%
  select(game,genre,global) %>%
  group_by(game,global) %>%
  filter(global>=5) %>%
  arrange(desc(global))

ggplot(data = top_xboxone_games) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = game, y = global, color = game))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+
  labs(title = "Highest rated xbox one video game", subtitle = "2014-2019")
```
From this plot, I can tell that Grand Theft Auto V is also the highest rated video game for Xbox between 2014 and 2018. 

Is it safe to say Grand Theft Auto V was the customers' favorite between 2014 and 2018 since it has the highest ratings for both consoles?

It is also very interesting to see that the Xbox version of this same Grand Theft Auto 5 has significantly lower ratings than the PS4 version does.

### Genre With The Highest Ratings
#### PS4

To achieve this, I ran the code below to count the number of PS4 game genres that have global ratings above 6. This will help us determine the video game genres that had the highest ratings all over the world from 2014 - 2018. 
 global)

```{r}

top_ps4_genre <- ps4_game_sales %>%
  select(game,genre,global) %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  filter(global>="5") %>%
  count(genre) %>%
  filter(n>1) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

```

From this bar chart I created with Tableau, we can see that shooting games had the highest ratings overall from 2014 - 2018. Even though a game with the shooter genre isn't the highest rated, the shooter genre has the highest ratings regardless for PS4 games. The action genre follows closely behind.

#### Xbox One
Applying the same method to determine the genre with the highest ratings for PS4, I'll do the same for xbox.But since xbox games generally have lower ratings than PS4 games, I'll apply the filter to select genres have 3 and above as their global rating.

```{r}
top_xboxone_genre <- xboxone_game_sales %>%
  select(game,genre,global) %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  filter(global>="3") %>%
  count(genre) %>%
  filter(n>1) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

From the bar chart above we can see that the shooter video game genre is by far the highest rated for the Xbox One console.

### Publishers With the Highest Number of Games
#### PS4
Next up, I will determine the publisher who put out the most PS4 games between 2014 and 2018.

```{r}
ps4_publishers <- ps4_game_sales %>% 
  select(publisher,game) %>%
  group_by(publisher) %>%
  count(publisher)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

![](\Users\JOLOMI AKPERI\OneDrive\Documents\my_projects\ps4_publishers.png)
 
Namco Bandai published the most PS4 games 

#### Xbox
I'll repeat the same process for Xbox One.
```{r}
xbox_publishers <- xboxone_game_sales %>% 
  select(publisher,game) %>%
  group_by(publisher) %>%
  count(publisher)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

![](\Users\JOLOMI AKPERI\OneDrive\Documents\my_projects\xbox_pub.png)

Microsoft Studios put out the most Xbox games. 

I can see from these two bar charts that Namco Bandai Games (the publisher with the highest number of games produced in 2014-2018) publishes both PS4 games and Xbox games but produced more of PS4 games than Xbox game.


On the other hand, Microsoft Studios put out the most Xbox games and did not put out a single PS4 game. This is simply because Microsoft owns Xbox. They definately won't make games for the competition.At the same time, Sony Interactive Entertainment owns PlayStation and does not have a single Xbox game.

Also, I find it interesting that even though Sony Interactive Entertainment owns PlayStation, they are not the publisher with the most PS4 games.

### Year With the Highest Rated Games
To determine the year with the highest rating, I ran the code below to count the number of release years that have global ratings above 5 (for PS4) and 3(for Xbox One) since Xbox One generally has lower ratings. This will help us determine the release year that had the highest rated games all over the world from 2014 - 2018.

#### PS4
```{r}
ps4_year <- ps4_game_sales %>%
  select(year,genre,global) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(global>="5") %>%
  count(year) %>%
  filter(n>1) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

#### Xbox One
```{r}
xbox_year <- xboxone_game_sales %>%
  select(year,genre,global) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(global>="3") %>%
  count(year) %>%
  filter(n>1) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Both Xbox One and PS4 have 2014 as the year in which they produced their highest rated games between 2014 and 2018. I can observe that there has been a decline in the ratings of video games with every year that passes. This is interesting because aren't the games meant to get better as the years go by? But who knows, a game could be technologically advanced but not interesting.


### Conclusion

It is interesting that video game ratings kept reducing as the years went by. Isn't meant to get better as the years go by? But who knows, a game could be technologically advanced but not interesting.
